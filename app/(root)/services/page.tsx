                        Since I work solo, none of the hours you pay for go into admin, or management.

                        But usually the simpler you manage to make your product, the better. 
                        I&apos;ve done a lot of different things, and I pick up new tech all the time. Let me know what you need, and I&apos;ll get on it. If it&apos;s new to me, I&apos;ll be transparent about it and offer a lower rate on it too

                    Budgets can be tight or might not exist in startups. 
                    Or maybe you&apos;re in the middle, on your way to scaling and expanding quickly with all the means. In that case - lets talk
                    If you&apos;re not, and still working on an idea stage, we might still be able to work something out. 
                    I do value a good product so pitch me and we&apos;ll see what model works for your company, that being a loan structure, equity, or fewer hours. 
                    There&apos;s usually always a way, if the product is good.

                        &quot;[...] it seems the problem is
                        only that with increasing people the communication effort
                        increases strongly. Yet, a high fraction of effort on communication seems like a good investment.&quot;

                    Even in an ideal world, as development teams grow, the total productivity increases, at the cost of productivity per developer.
                    This is just a consequence of people having to work together. In other words, as the size of a team goes up, productivity per member goes down.  
                    To scale a company, and increase development output, it&apos;s a necessary &quot;evil&quot; to simply hire more developers.
                    So that&apos;s where hiring a solo developer has benefits. Depending on your company and it&apos;s existing tech, there are pros and cons. 
                    In a startup and working from scratch, there are really only benefits as it&apos;s also usually what you&apos;d do.
                    When it comes to existing codebases and tech, you&apos;d have to consider integration costs. A feature or product can be either built-in, or made as a standalone api, depending on your current solution.
                    As you only pay for development, figuring out what solution would work for you happens before paying for anything at all.
